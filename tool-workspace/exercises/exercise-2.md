# Exercise 2

1. Create two new libraries named `calc-tool-lib` and `car-tool-lib`.

2. In each library create an appropriately named Home component.

3. Configure the default route of each library to use the library's Home component.

4. Wire up each library into the `tool-app` project in similar fashion to how `color-tool-lib` is wired up. The library modules should be lazy loaded. When navigate to, the library's routing module should display the Home component. Add two entries to the menu bar to load the Home components of the two libraries.

5. Ensure it works!
